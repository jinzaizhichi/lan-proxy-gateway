Turn your computer into a LAN-wide transparent proxy gateway.  
No router flashing, no extra soft router, just change the gateway and DNS on your `Switch / PS5 / Apple TV / smart TV / phone`.

This project is built on `mihomo` and focuses on two things:

- `LAN sharing`: devices that cannot install proxy apps can still use transparent proxying
- `Chains`: `Claude / ChatGPT / Codex / Cursor` can use a cleaner residential exit

> Fully open source. Chinese-first project, but the networking model is globally applicable.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. LAN-wide transparent sharing

- Devices join by changing only gateway and DNS
- Supports `Switch / PS5 / Apple TV / smart TV / phone / tablet`
- Supports `TUN` mode and `bypass local host`

### 2. Chains mode

```text
Your device -> airport node -> residential proxy -> Claude / ChatGPT / Codex / Cursor
```

Useful for:

- Claude / ChatGPT signup and usage
- Codex / Cursor style AI coding tools
- keeping daily traffic on airport nodes while AI traffic uses residential exit

### 3. Runtime console

By default, `gateway start` opens the plain command console. It is the more compatible mode, and it is the safer default while the runtime TUI is still being refined.

Common plain-command actions include:

- `nodes`
- `subscription`
- `extension`
- `chain`
- `help`

Extra notes:

- default `help` now stays focused on common actions; use `help all` for the full command list
- `nodes` opens a node workbench that shows per-node latency, lets you press `T` to retest, and reorders the list by lower latency first
- after opening `subscription / extension / chain`, you can type the panel shortcuts like `1 / 2 / A / S / R ...` instead of entering the full command every time

If you want the full runtime TUI workbench, use:

```bash
sudo gateway start --tui
```

The TUI workspace gives you:

- tabs, arrow-key navigation, and Enter-to-run actions
- the right side clearly labels each page as `info / action / confirm`
- a command bar at the bottom for direct commands
- `Ctrl+P` opens the node workbench for switching nodes and pressing `T` to test the current node latency
- `Esc` back to the top tabs, `←/→` to switch sections, and `↓` back into the action list
- `R` refreshes the current page and gives a short visual refresh cue

If you are already in simple mode, you can also type `tui` to switch into it later.

### 4. Rule system

Built-in defaults include:

- LAN and reserved address direct access
- common mainland-China services direct access
- Apple / Nintendo related rules
- ad and tracking domain blocking
- proxy rules for overseas sites and AI services

## 3-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Install

Install `gateway` first. For users in mainland China, the CDN entry is usually easier.

#### macOS / Linux

Recommended:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway@main/install.sh | bash
```

Fallback:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows PowerShell

Recommended:

```powershell
irm https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway@main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Fallback:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

If GitHub is unstable from your network, you can also force a mirror:

```bash
GITHUB_MIRROR=https://hub.gitmirror.com/ bash install.sh
```

The install script now probes download candidates first and can switch away from a persistently slow source automatically, but forcing a mirror is still the most predictable option on restricted networks.

### Step 2: Initialize

```bash
gateway install
```

The setup wizard will:

1. automatically download the official `mihomo` kernel (on Windows x86_64 it downloads the official zip and installs it locally as `mihomo.exe`)
2. ask for a subscription URL or local config file
3. generate `gateway.yaml`

If you just want the fastest path, only fill these:

- proxy source
- subscription URL or local config file
- subscription name

### Step 3: Start the gateway

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
sudo gateway start
```

**Windows (run in an Administrator terminal):**

```powershell
gateway start
```

Extra notes:

- `gateway update` now uses a background replacement flow on Windows, so the current `.exe` can be swapped after exit and the gateway is restarted automatically
- `gateway service install` uses Task Scheduler on Windows instead of pretending the CLI itself is a native `sc.exe` service

By default, startup enters the plain command console and shows:

- the config file path in use
- your LAN gateway IP
- runtime mode
- egress summary
- the simple-mode command prompt
- direct commands for common settings

The default workspace now handles these common tasks directly:

- node switching with latency display and full-group retest sorting
- proxy source and subscription info
- TUN and local bypass
- recommended rule switches such as China direct and ad blocking
- `chains / script / off`
- `rule / global` for chains mode
- residential proxy and airport group settings

Default `help` stays centered on those high-frequency actions; use `help all` when you need the longer command list.

The most important thing here is your LAN IP.

If you want the runtime TUI workbench:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
sudo gateway start --tui

# Windows (Administrator terminal)
gateway start --tui
```

The TUI provides the `Home / Proxy / Subscription` tabs, node switching, config workbenches, and the Dashboard view. If you still want to spell out the default, `gateway start --simple` is still accepted.

If you leave the console, you can re-enter it at any time:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
sudo gateway console
sudo gateway console --tui

# Windows (Administrator terminal)
gateway console
gateway console --tui
```

### Step 4: Connect another device

Change the device's:

- `Gateway` to your computer's LAN IP
- `DNS` to the same IP

If you want a quick first test, start with:

- [iPhone / Android](docs/en/phone-setup.md)
- [Nintendo Switch](docs/en/switch-setup.md)
- [PS5](docs/en/ps5-setup.md)
- [Apple TV](docs/en/appletv-setup.md)
- [Smart TV](docs/en/tv-setup.md)

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
gateway status
```

You will see:

- current node
- entry node
- regular exit
- residential exit, if `chains` is enabled

## Common Commands

> **Windows users:** commands listed with `sudo` must be run in an **Administrator terminal** without the `sudo` prefix — e.g. `sudo gateway start` → `gateway start`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gateway install` | Initial setup wizard |
| `gateway config` | Interactive config center |
| `sudo gateway start` | Start gateway and open the default plain command console |
| `sudo gateway start --tui` | Start gateway and open the runtime TUI workbench |
| `sudo gateway console` | Re-enter the plain command console without restarting the gateway |
| `sudo gateway console --tui` | Re-enter the runtime TUI workbench without restarting the gateway |
| `gateway tun on` | Enable TUN transparent proxy mode |
| `gateway tun off` | Disable TUN transparent proxy mode |
| `gateway status` | Show runtime and egress status |
| `gateway chains` | Chains / residential proxy wizard |
| `gateway switch` | Switch proxy source and extension mode |
| `gateway skill` | Show AI skill info |
| `gateway permission install` | Install passwordless control rule (macOS/Linux only) |
| `sudo gateway service install` | Install auto-start (implemented with Task Scheduler on Windows) |
| `sudo gateway update` | Upgrade to the latest version |

```

1. The computer enables IP forwarding and becomes the LAN gateway
2. `mihomo` captures traffic in TUN mode
3. The rule system decides direct, proxy, or block
4. In `chains` mode, AI traffic can continue to a residential exit

## How It Differs from Clash Verge LAN Access

| Item | Clash Verge LAN Access | LAN Proxy Gateway |
|---|---|---|
| Proxy layer | Application-level proxy | Network-level transparent proxy |
| Device setup | Fill proxy server address | Change gateway and DNS |
| Switch / Apple TV / PS5 | Limited in some cases | Better for full-device transparent takeover |
| App proxy awareness | Often detectable | Closer to a real gateway |
| Typical use | Per-device proxy | Whole-home shared gateway |

## Open Source
