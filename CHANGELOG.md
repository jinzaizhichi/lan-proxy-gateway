# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## v3.4.11 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Fixed `install.sh` treating mirror error pages as valid release tarballs. Some GitHub proxy mirrors can return HTML or other invalid content with a curl-successful response, which made the installer fail later with `tar: Error opening archive: Unrecognized archive format`.
- `install.sh` now validates downloaded content before accepting a candidate source: GitHub API responses must contain `tag_name`, and release `.tar.gz` assets must pass both `gzip -t` and `tar -tzf`. Invalid content now triggers fallback to the next source.

## v3.4.10 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Fixed the Gateway Web control panel disappearing after `gateway start` returned to the shell. Background starts now spawn a dedicated WebUI daemon for `runtime.ports.web_ui` (default `19091`), keep its PID in `webui.pid`, and stop it from `gateway stop` / `gateway restart`.
- Fixed console WebUI guidance pointing users to mihomo's `http://<IP>:9090/ui/` instead of the Gateway control panel. The dashboard now prioritizes `http://<IP>:19091/#token=...` and keeps mihomo `/ui/` as a secondary "complete console" link.
- Fixed `gateway webui` probing when the printed URL contains `#token=...`; the health check now strips fragment/query data before requesting `/api/ping`.

### Changed

- Added the hidden `gateway __webui-serve` command used internally by `gateway start` to host the Gateway WebUI as a background process.
- Console source screens now probe the Gateway WebUI root path when showing Web control panel availability.

## v3.4.9 - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Fixed `gateway update` returning `EOF` (and on one mirror, `malformed HTTP response "\x00\x00\x12\x04..."`) when run behind an HTTPS proxy. `tr.ForceAttemptHTTP2 = false` did not actually disable HTTP/2 on a cloned `http.DefaultTransport`: TLS ALPN still negotiated h2 while the application read responses as h1. Removed the line and let the transport handle HTTP/2 normally.
- Fixed `gateway update` losing the user's `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` after self-elevation. The update flow used to run entirely as root via `maybeElevate`; on macOS the default sudoers `env_reset` policy strips proxy variables before the elevated process sees them. Reworked the flow so version lookup and asset download happen in the user's environment, then a thin sudo re-exec hands the prefetched temp path to the root child for the stop/replace/restart step — the root child no longer touches the network.
- Added a release-page redirect fallback when GitHub's `/releases/latest` API and every mirror fail. The fallback follows the 302 from `https://github.com/<repo>/releases/latest` and extracts the tag from the final URL.

### Changed

- Refactored `cmd/update.go` for maintainability: pulled three string literals (`"User-Agent"`, `"lan-proxy-gateway"`, `"%s: %v"`) into module-level constants and extracted three helpers (`prepareUpdateBinary`, `stopGatewayBeforeUpdate`, `restartGatewayAfterUpdate`) so `runUpdate` and `installUpdateBinary` drop below the cognitive-complexity threshold. No behavior change.
- Marked `legacy/` as an archive via a new `legacy/README.md`. The directory's shell scripts and `legacy/v1/` Go module are kept only for git-history reference.
- Relocated stand-alone helper scripts: `install-mihomo.sh` and `download-mihomo.sh` move to `scripts/`, root keeps a 4-line wrapper that `exec`s the real target so `bash install-mihomo.sh` still works. `script-demo.js` renames to `examples/extension.js`; `docs/advanced.md` / `docs/en/advanced.md` updated to track the rename. `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `dev.sh`, `dev.ps1` stay at repo root.
- Expanded `make clean` to also remove `.tmp/`, `.cache/`, `.try/`, `logs/*.log` and `.DS_Store` everywhere. `handoff_unfinished_tasks.txt` is intentionally not touched.

## v3.4.8 - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Added the Gateway Web control panel on `runtime.ports.web_ui` (default `19091`) with token-protected API access and a `gateway webui` helper command.
- Added homepage proxy-source status and quick source switching for configured source profiles.
- Added Clash-style policy-group controls in the WebUI, including scrollable group selection, node switching, and one-click latency tests.
- Added independent TUN and LAN proxy-service controls. `runtime.proxy_service` can enable/disable `mixed-port` and optionally set username/password authentication.
- Added version/update check controls in the WebUI.
- Added full built-in ruleset previews with scroll and copy support.

### Changed

- WebUI dashboard now reports connected device count by unique source IP instead of counting each network request as an active connection.
- TUN transparent proxy and HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy service are treated as independent capabilities; `gateway.mode` no longer implies a mutually exclusive homepage state.
- README now points users to the Gateway WebUI at `http://gatewayIP:19091/`.

### Fixed

- Fixed closing TUN from the WebUI still showing TUN as enabled after refresh. Loopback external proxy safety now only forces local bypass when TUN is already enabled, and no longer turns TUN/DNS back on.
- Fixed homepage capability text showing the old "port mode" label when TUN was enabled.
- Fixed the quick policy-group area for subscriptions with many groups by replacing fixed cards with a scrollable group list and current-group node pane.

### Tests

- Added/updated config and render tests for loopback external source with explicit TUN off.
- Added proxy-service render tests for authentication and disabled `mixed-port`.
- Added WebUI API tests for the new control surface.

## v3.4.7 - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- Corrected the v3.4.6 local single-proxy safety behavior. When `source.type=external` points to a loopback proxy such as `127.0.0.1:6578`, gateway now keeps LAN transparent gateway mode available: runtime TUN and DNS are forced on when `gateway.enabled=true`, while TUN local bypass is forced so mihomo renders `strict-route: false`. This preserves both LAN `mixed-port` sharing (`gatewayIP:17890`) and "change gateway + DNS" transparent proxying without capturing the upstream proxy client's own traffic.
- Local single-proxy supervisor checks no longer perform fixed HTTP health probes or auto-switch mihomo to `direct`. The background supervisor only verifies the loopback upstream port is open, avoiding false "source unhealthy" warnings and unwanted runtime mode changes when the upstream client can serve real traffic but `generate_204` probes time out.
- External/remote manual source tests now try multiple lightweight health URLs and accept the first successful response, while still rejecting open-but-broken proxy ports.
- Added Fast.com / Netflix speedtest domains to the built-in global proxy rules, including `fast.com`, `api.fast.com`, Netflix API/logging hosts, and `nflxvideo.net`.
- Added the documented `gateway restart` command.
- In the menu drawer, `Q` / `0` / Enter now return to the dashboard. Only dashboard `Q` exits the console; menu item `6` still stops gateway/mihomo and exits.

### Tests

- Updated runtime-config and render tests to prove local loopback external mode keeps gateway/TUN/DNS enabled and renders `strict-route: false`.
- Added source health tests for multi-probe checks and TCP-only supervisor checks.
- Added traffic-rule coverage for the Fast.com speedtest chain.
- Updated console tests for menu `Q` returning to the dashboard.

## v3.4.6 - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- Local single-proxy mode is now protected from self-proxy loops. When `source.type=external` points to a loopback host such as `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or `::1`, gateway now runs as a LAN mixed-port sharer only: it keeps `mixed-port` available for devices, but disables transparent gateway, DNS listener, and TUN routing at runtime. This prevents gateway from capturing the upstream proxy client's own outbound traffic and breaking the whole chain.
- Source health checks for `external` and `remote` proxies now perform a real proxy request to `http://www.gstatic.com/generate_204` instead of only checking that the TCP port is open. An open but unusable proxy port is now reported as unhealthy immediately.
- Console wording now explicitly says TUN is for "change gateway" devices, while phone/computer clients that manually set `gatewayIP:17890` should keep TUN off when chaining through a local proxy client.

### Tests

- Added runtime-config tests for loopback external proxy detection and non-mutating safety-mode generation.
- Added render tests proving local external proxy mode emits `tun.enable=false` and `dns.enable=false`.
- Added source tests that reject an open TCP port that is not a functioning proxy.
- Added app test proving local external proxy mode skips transparent gateway enablement.

## v3.4.5 - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- `gateway update vX.Y.Z` no longer calls the GitHub release-tag API before comparing versions. A pinned update such as `gateway update v3.4.4` now resolves locally to that exact tag first, so an already-current install can return immediately instead of failing on a GitHub API timeout.
- `gateway update` / `gateway update latest` still fetch the latest release. Common mistypes `laste` and `lastest` are treated as `latest`.
- Release-version lookup now gives every candidate source its own timeout budget. Previously the first slow GitHub API request could consume the shared context, causing all mirror candidates to fail immediately with `context deadline exceeded` without really being tried.
- CLI errors are no longer printed twice by Cobra on failure.
- Console `Q` now matches the text shown on screen: it exits the console and leaves mihomo running in the background. Use menu item `6` to stop gateway/mihomo and exit.

### Docs

- README and command docs now explicitly list `gateway update latest`.

### Tests

- Added update tests for pinned-version resolution without network access and `latest` mistype normalization.
- Added console tests for `Q` exiting the console and `0` returning to the dashboard.

## v3.4.4 - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- `gateway stop` no longer flips `net.ipv4.ip_forward` back to `0` when the host already had IP forwarding enabled before `gateway start` ran. Previously, every stop unconditionally turned forwarding off, which broke docker port-publish access from the LAN: `LAN device → host:2228 → docker DNAT → container` requires cross-interface forwarding, and docker hosts almost always have `ip_forward=1` independent of gateway. Reported by @lingbaoboy in [issue #5](https://github.com/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway/issues/5) (immich on Debian 13 / docker, 10.0.0.11:2228 became unreachable from LAN after `gateway stop`). Now `gateway start` records the prior `ip_forward` state in `~/.config/lan-proxy-gateway/runtime.state`, and `gateway stop` only reverts to `0` if gateway was the one that flipped it on.
- `gateway stop` now actually removes the `MASQUERADE` rule on the egress interface. Previously `Gateway.Disable()` skipped `UnconfigureNAT` when its in-memory `info.Interface` was empty — which is exactly the case for `gateway stop` running as a fresh process. Now it reads the interface name from the runtime state file (and falls back to live `DetectNetwork()` if no state exists), so the rule is removed across process boundaries.

### Tests

- `internal/gateway/state.go` + 6 new cases in `internal/gateway/gateway_test.go`:
  - `ip_forward=1` before Enable → Disable preserves it (issue #5 primary fix)
  - `ip_forward=0` before Enable → Disable reverts to `0`
  - Cross-process `Disable` reads `NATInterface` from state file and unconfigures NAT
  - No state file (upgrade path) → Disable falls back to `Detect()` for NAT cleanup and leaves `ip_forward` untouched
  - `PostStopCleanup` always runs
  - Re-`Enable()` is idempotent and preserves the `WeEnabledIPForward` flag

## v3.4.3 - 2026-05-14

### Added

- `gateway update [version]` now accepts an optional target release tag, so users can update or roll back to a specific release such as `v3.4.3` or `3.3.2`. Without an argument it still upgrades to the latest release.

### Fixed

- `gateway stop` and in-console shutdown now restore local DNS when it had been pointed at `127.0.0.1`, preventing the host network from staying broken after the gateway exits.
- The device access guide is now a compact quick-reference table instead of a long prose checklist.

### Changed

- The GitHub release workflow now uses Go 1.25, matching `go.mod`.

## v3.4.2 - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Bumped pinned mihomo from `v1.18.6` to `v1.19.24`. Adds support for the `anytls` proxy type that landed in mihomo v1.19.3 (resolves [issue #4](https://github.com/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway/issues/4): subscriptions with `type: anytls` nodes were rejected with `unsupport proxy type: anytls`). v1.19.24 also brings vless reality fixes, hysteria2 stability, and several CVE patches for net/http. New users get this automatically; existing users on v1.18.6 must run the new `gateway install --reinstall-mihomo` flag (see Added) — `gateway install` alone won't re-download because it skips the step when mihomo is already on disk.
- Mihomo SIGTERM → SIGKILL grace bumped from **3s to 8s** on Unix. mihomo's TUN strict-route shutdown work (deleting high-pref ip rules, flushing custom routing table, tearing down the tun device) sometimes didn't fit in 3s; the SIGKILL escalation cut it short, leaving the rules behind (root cause of [issue #5](https://github.com/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway/issues/5)). 8s is generous for the normal case (clean exit < 2s) but gives slow / busy hosts real headroom.

### Added

- `gateway install --reinstall-mihomo` flag forces re-download of mihomo even if a binary already exists on disk, overwriting it with the version pinned to the current gateway release. Primary use: lifting v3.4.1 (mihomo v1.18.6) installs to v3.4.2 (mihomo v1.19.24) so subscriptions with anytls nodes start working
- New `Platform.PostStopCleanup()` hook on the OS abstraction. No-op on darwin / windows; on Linux it scrubs leftover mihomo TUN strict-route ip rules whose pref looks like mihomo's signature (`9000-9999` + `unreachable` action). Defends against the case where mihomo got SIGKILL'd mid-cleanup or crashed, leaving stale `pref 9000 from all unreachable` rules behind that could break Docker DNAT for non-port-preserving port mappings (`host:container 2228:2283` style — root cause of [issue #5](https://github.com/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway/issues/5)). Wired into `gateway.Disable()` so it always runs on `gateway stop` after mihomo terminates and after the MASQUERADE rule has been removed

### Tests

- `internal/platform/cleanup_parser_test.go` — 7 cases covering the leftover-rule parser: detects mihomo signature, ignores clean systems, refuses to touch admin's own high-pref non-unreachable rules, refuses pref outside [9000,9999], handles multiple leftovers, handles empty / junk input. Parser lives in a portable file (`cleanup_parser.go`) so darwin / windows CI also runs the tests.
- `internal/gateway/gateway_test.go` — asserts `Gateway.Disable()` calls `UnconfigureNAT` → `DisableIPForward` → `PostStopCleanup` in that order, and that `PostStopCleanup` still runs when no interface was detected (defense-in-depth — the cleanup is independent of NAT teardown).
- `internal/mihomo/download_test.go::TestPinnedMihomoVersionSatisfiesAnytls` — version-pin guardrail. Refuses any future bump back below mihomo v1.19, where anytls support starts. Catches accidental regressions during cherry-picks / merges.

## v3.4.1 - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- `gateway install` now generates a systemd unit with `After=network-online.target` + `Wants=network-online.target` instead of the old `After=network.target`. On Debian 13 with DHCP, the previous unit fired before the interface had an IPv4 lease, causing `gateway start` to fail with `detect network: no IPv4 address on enp0s1` and noisy auto-restart loops in `journalctl`. Reported by @lingbaoboy in [issue #2](https://github.com/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway/issues/2). Reinstall the service (`sudo gateway install`) to pick up the new unit
- `traffic.auto_groups` now also injects the appended `Auto` / `Fallback` group names + `DIRECT` into the user's `Proxy` select group (appended at the tail, never reordering the head). v3.4.0 added `Auto` / `Fallback` to the proxy-groups list but the user's `Proxy` group did not reference them, so they showed up in the mihomo UI but could not actually be selected from the main entrypoint group ("看得见用不着"). DIRECT injection also gives a last-resort escape hatch when every node is down, so the host doesn't lose basic connectivity. Behavior change is gated on `auto_groups: true` only — users who never opted in see no difference

### Tests

- `internal/source/source_autogroups_test.go` — three new scenarios: existing url-test/fallback groups (named `🚀 自动` / `🛡 兜底`) get injected into Proxy, the auto-synthesized fallback Proxy group also receives Auto/Fallback/DIRECT, and `auto_groups=false` keeps Proxy's proxies list bit-identical to the subscription
- Existing `AutoGroupsAppendsBoth` updated to assert the Proxy group now contains `n1, n2, n3, Auto, Fallback, DIRECT` with `n1` still at index 0 (preserving mihomo's default selection)

## v3.4.0 - 2026-04-24

### Added

- `traffic.auto_groups` config (default `false`) plus a toggle in `[M] → 2 分流 & 规则 → 5 策略组自动补全`. When enabled, subscription / file sources get two extra groups injected only when missing: `Auto` (`type: url-test`) and `Fallback` (`type: fallback`), both referencing every proxy in the subscription. The detection is **by group type, not name**, so custom-named subscriptions (`🚀 节点选择`, `智能选择`, etc.) are recognized and no duplicate groups appear. Restores the v2.x template behavior that was lost in the v3.0 rewrite. Resolves the "no fallback when a directly selected node goes down" report in [issue #2](https://github.com/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway/issues/2).

### Tests

- `internal/source/source_autogroups_test.go` — five scenarios: off, append both when subscription only has `select`, skip Auto when `url-test` exists, skip both when both types exist, rename to `Auto2` on name clash

## v3.3.2 - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Embedded mihomo template no longer forces `ipv6: false` and `dns.ipv6: false`; both default to `true` again, matching v2.x behavior. The hard-off was inherited from the v1 legacy template during the v3.0 rewrite and broke dual-stack targets (ChatGPT / Cloudflare / Google) for IPv6-preferring clients. The TUN block intentionally still does **not** hijack IPv6 routes, so the host's IPv6 reachability stays intact (avoids re-triggering the Linux-side IPv6 ping issue from [issue #2](https://github.com/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway/issues/2))

## v3.3.1 - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Dashboard no longer duplicates "🛫 起飞 / 🛬 落地" as identical lines when there is no chain residential configured; single-hop setups now render one `🌐 出口节点` line, with the ipinfo egress row below providing the ground-truth location
- Added a `mixed` port health probe to the dashboard refresh: when the mihomo API is reachable but the LAN-facing mixed port is not (e.g. reload half-failed, TUN strict-route stole the port, or firewall blocks LAN ingress), the dashboard now prints a red "代理端口不通：LAN 设备连不上" warning with a repair hint instead of silently showing "● 运行中" while phones time out

## v3.3.0 - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Dashboard shows the real egress IP, location, and ISP under the 🛬 landing line by querying `https://ipinfo.io/json` through the local mixed port — gives an accurate read for chain-proxy / residential-IP setups where the flag emoji in a node name can lie
- `ls` now renders the full node list as a Linux-style multi-column grid (column-major, fastest in the first column, CJK/emoji width-aware) and `ll` renders the detailed single-column table; terminal width adapts via `COLUMNS`
- Log tail (readable mode) folds consecutive duplicate warnings with a `⋮ 上面那一行又重复 N 次（最近 HH:MM:SS）` summary, fixing the 15-second direct-timeout spam that used to swamp the screen
- `gateway.yaml` gained `gateway.device_labels: {ip: name}` so the dashboard device table can show user-assigned names over reverse-DNS fallback
- New `internal/ipinfo/`, `internal/geoip/`, and `internal/devices/` packages with unit tests

### Fixed

- `subscription` reload no longer self-bites under active TUN/fake-ip: `engine.Reload` fetches through the **old** mixed port before stopping and starting, avoiding `read: can't assign requested address` on 198.18.0.0/15
- No-op edits in "代理 & 订阅" (subscription URL/name, file path, script screen) no longer trigger `Save` + `Reload` when the user just presses Enter on defaults
- `gateway install` generates a systemd unit that includes `Environment=HOME=…` / `Environment=XDG_CONFIG_HOME=…/.config`, so Debian/Linux users who did `sudo gateway install` no longer end up with the service reading `/root/.config/…` and ignoring the real config ([issue #2](https://github.com/Tght1211/lan-proxy-gateway/issues/2))
- macOS `SetLocalDNSToLoopback` now also turns off system HTTP / HTTPS / SOCKS proxy state, so the method-3 DNS takeover isn't bypassed by a lingering system proxy
- Subscription / file content normalization handles UTF-8 BOM, `#!MANAGED-CONFIG` headers, and base64-encoded Clash YAML; fallback `Proxy` group is emitted as structured YAML instead of a malformed string

### Changed

- The "启动 / 重启 / 停止" menu now shows a calm hint when gateway is already running ("重启/停止 通常不需要 sudo") instead of the old blanket "启动/停止/清理会失败" warning — matches actual runtime behavior

## v2.2.10 - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- Reworked `install.sh` so release downloads no longer sit on a slow direct GitHub asset connection for minutes before trying the next source
- Added fast candidate probing, low-speed cutover, and retry rotation across direct GitHub plus known mirrors for the Unix install script
- Forced the Unix install script to prefer `curl --http1.1` by default, which improves release-asset download stability on affected macOS networks

### Documentation

- Updated the Chinese and English README install sections to explain the new automatic download-source probing and when `GITHUB_MIRROR` is still the better manual fallback
- Updated the install success hints so `gateway start` / `gateway start --tui` match the current default simple-mode startup behavior

## v2.2.9 - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- Switched the default interactive startup for `gateway start`, `gateway console`, and `gateway restart` back to the plain command console so day-to-day use no longer drops users into the still-maturing TUI first
- Added an explicit `--tui` flag on the same commands, while keeping `--simple` as an accepted explicit alias for the new default mode
- Updated the simple-console help text so switching into the TUI is described as entering the TUI workbench instead of the old "default TUI" wording

### Added

- Added shared console-mode resolution logic plus tests to keep the default-mode behavior, restart flow, and conflicting `--simple` / `--tui` flag handling consistent

### Documentation

- Updated the Chinese and English README files, command references, advanced guides, and install-complete hints to explain that simple mode is now the default and TUI is opt-in

## v2.2.8 - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- Replaced the old runtime-console home page with a Clash-style dashboard that surfaces subscription usage, current node, TUN status, traffic, IP path, and common-site latency in one screen
- Simplified the top-level TUI layout into three tabs: Home, Proxy, and Subscription
- Removed the old bottom command bar and moved confirmations plus parameter entry into centered modal overlays
- Kept `R` refreshes on the current page instead of bouncing guide/info pages back to the home tab

### Added

- Added persistent subscription profiles via `proxy.profiles` and `current_profile`, so multiple URL/file subscriptions can be saved and switched cleanly
- Added simple-console subscription commands: `subscription`, `subscription add url|file <name> <value>`, and `subscription use <name>`
- Added richer left-side preview cards with "current summary" and "next step" hints for the focused workspace

### Documentation

- Updated the Chinese README and release notes for the dashboard redesign and subscription workspace flow

## v2.2.7 - 2026-04-03

### Fixed (Windows)

- **Chinese garbled output** — set the console to UTF-8 (code page 65001) and enable ANSI virtual terminal processing at startup, so all Chinese text renders correctly in cmd.exe, PowerShell, and Windows Terminal instead of appearing as mojibake
- **`gateway` not found after install** — `install.ps1` now also refreshes `$env:Path` in the current PowerShell session, so the command is usable immediately without reopening the terminal
- **Administrator detection** — replaced the fragile `net session` probe with a Windows token membership check, so admin detection no longer depends on optional services
- **`IsRunning()` locale bug** — replaced the GBK-unsafe `"没有"` / `"No tasks"` check with a locale-independent `"mihomo.exe"` presence check, so process detection works correctly on Chinese Windows
- **`IsIPForwardingEnabled()` locale bug** — replaced `netsh` output parsing (which emits Chinese text on Chinese Windows) with a direct registry read of `HKLM\...\IPEnableRouter`, making forwarding detection locale-independent
- **Default NIC detection** — Windows now resolves the active interface from the default route table instead of guessing the first active adapter, which avoids picking VPN / virtualization adapters by mistake
- **Auto-start implementation** — Windows `gateway service install` now installs an auto-start Task Scheduler task instead of trying to register the CLI as a native `sc.exe` service
- **Self-update on Windows** — `gateway update` now uses a detached updater script so the running `.exe` can be replaced and restarted correctly even while the current binary is locked
- **`/tmp/` path hardcoded** — `start` and `console` commands now use `os.TempDir()` for the log file path, which resolves to the correct temporary directory on Windows
- **Unix-only hints leaking into Windows** — runtime hints now use `gateway <sub>` / `Get-Content -Wait` on Windows instead of `sudo ...` and `tail -f ...`
- **`~\...` local config paths** — file-path expansion now supports Windows-style home shortcuts in setup and switching flows

## v2.2.6 - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- When focus stays in the left navigation list, `←/→` no longer switches top tabs by mistake
- Added a short red boundary feedback in the navigation list, with an explicit `Esc` hint for returning to the top tab area
- Added a whole-page refresh pulse for `R`, so refreshes now feel visible instead of silent
- Stopped preview pages from repeating the same title and hint text in the right-side pane
- Enabled mouse-wheel scrolling when the main detail area is focused and content overflows
- Updated the `gateway install` completion screen to show both startup modes and the `console` re-entry commands

### Changed

- Turned the runtime console from a mostly read-only TUI into a real workbench with action pages for:
  - proxy source
  - TUN / local bypass
  - recommended rule switches
  - extension mode
  - residential proxy fields
- Brought the plain command mode closer to feature parity with the TUI, so core config changes can also be done with commands such as `proxy`, `tun`, `rule`, `extension`, and `chain`

### Documentation

- Updated the Chinese and English README files plus command reference docs for the new console workbenches and plain-command examples

## v2.2.5 - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows `gateway install` so it can extract the official `mihomo-windows-amd64-compatible-*.zip` package and rename the extracted kernel to local `mihomo.exe`
- Fixed Windows `gateway update` so it downloads `gateway-windows-amd64.exe` instead of a missing extensionless asset
- Re-verified the pinned official `mihomo v1.19.8` Windows asset URL and archive structure against the upstream MetaCubeX release

### Documentation

- Updated the Chinese and English READMEs plus release notes to clarify the Windows kernel download path

## v2.2.4 - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Reworked the runtime TUI so right-side pages clearly indicate whether they are info pages, action pages, or confirm pages
- Added real detail-area focus, so pressing Enter moves focus into the right pane and `Esc` returns to the left menu
- Turned the node entry into a node workbench with clearer action hints and built-in current-node latency testing via `T`
- Replaced the TUI device and extension pages with native TUI rendering for more consistent layout

### Documentation

- Updated the Chinese and English READMEs plus command docs to explain the new node-workbench and page-type flow

## v2.2.3 - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- `R` in the runtime TUI now refreshes the current page instead of replacing it with a generic refresh message
- Added a short visual refresh pulse so refresh actions feel visible in the terminal

### Documentation

- Updated the Chinese and English READMEs plus command docs to describe the refresh behavior

## v2.2.2 - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Replaced the TUI `功能导航` page with native TUI rendering so it no longer picks up broken separator lines or duplicated section titles
- Added a real header focus state so `Esc` from the navigation list now returns to the top tabs as expected
- Made the top tab area visibly focusable, with `←/→` to switch sections and `↓ / Enter` to go back into the action list

### Documentation

- Updated the Chinese and English READMEs with clearer runtime-console controls
- Updated the command reference docs to explain the new header-focus navigation flow

## v2.2.1 - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Reworked the runtime TUI so navigation no longer re-runs heavy status probes on every arrow key press
- Removed the distracting pet panel and reduced redraw pressure with a lighter two-column layout
- Fixed TUI focus feedback so the active area is highlighted more clearly
- Replaced captured CLI output in the TUI status and config pages with native TUI rendering
- Added `gateway console` and `gateway console --simple` so users can reopen the workspace without restarting the gateway
- Improved plain-command help text and renamed the main node-switching entry to `nodes` while keeping `groups` compatible

### Changed

- `Q` in the TUI now asks for confirmation instead of exiting immediately
- `R` in the TUI now shows a visible refresh result and timestamp
- `config` inside the TUI now stays in the TUI first; `config open` is the explicit path to the full interactive config center
